# Homework Assignment

This project provides a simple Java application that interacts with the [https://http.cat](https://http.cat) service to retrieve images corresponding to HTTP status codes. The application is divided into three main parts:

1. **HttpStatusChecker**: Retrieves the URL of the image for a given HTTP status code.
2. **HttpStatusImageDownloader**: Downloads the image corresponding to a given HTTP status code and saves it locally.
3. **HttpImageStatusCli**: A simple command-line interface (CLI) that interacts with the user, allowing them to input a status code, check if an image exists, and download it.
